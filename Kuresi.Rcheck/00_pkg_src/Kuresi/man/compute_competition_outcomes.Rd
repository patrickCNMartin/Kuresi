\arguments{
\item{counts}{A matrix or sparse matrix containing gene expression
counts.}

\item{groups}{A data frame, matrix, or named vector containing group
assignments for cells.}

\item{gene_set1}{A character vector of gene names representing the
first gene set.}

\item{group_name}{Character string specifying the column name in
groups if groups is a data frame.}

\item{gene_set2}{Optional character vector of gene names representing
the second gene set.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the statistical test method
(default: "wilcox").}

\item{log_fc}{Numeric threshold for log fold change (default: 0).}

\item{pval}{Numeric threshold for adjusted p-value (default: 0.05).}
}
\value{
A nested list containing differential expression outcomes
  between all group pairs.
}
